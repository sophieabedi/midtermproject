    <h1>Free Guy</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Released: 2021</p>
    <p>Genre: Action-comedy</p>
    <p>Directed by: Shawn Levy</p>
    <p>About: Free Guy is a film about a character named 'Guy' who is an NPC and lives in Free City, a large city designed for roleplay.
    Guy does not know that he lives in a video game, but continues to live as a Bank Teller with his best friend Buddy, a security guard. Throughout the film
  there are parallels with the video game and real life. In real life, Millie Rusk is attempting to find evidence that the source code for the game was stolen
 by Antwan Hovachelik. Guy starts to alter his perception of where he is when Millie enters the game and starts playing his favorite song, 'Fantasy.' With this,
his NPC programming has altered. Guy is able to get glasses from someone robbing a bank, which shows the interfaces of the video game. The developers of the game
believe that Guy is hacking and try to ban him, but fail since he is not an actual player. Guy and Millie team up to find evidence of the source code within the game before
it is wiped by Free City 2.</p>
<p>Thoughts: As this movie came out very recently, I was happy to watch another film based around the concept of false worlds, just like The Truman Show & Bandersnatch. I loved
how they included the NPC to be the main character as those are usually the most looked over characters in video games. In comparison with the other films, I wish they did a better job
of how Guy recognizes the life he has lived to be completely false, but I do understand that this was mainly a comedy and they kept everything light-hearted. This is definitely
a film worth watching!</p>
