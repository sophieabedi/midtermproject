    <h1>Bandersnatch</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Released: 2018</p>
    <p>Genre: Science-fiction</p>
    <p>Directed by: David Slade</p>
    <p>About: Bandersnatch is an interactive film created by Black Mirror, a TV series. Stefan Butler, the main character,
    is creating a fantasy gamebook into a video game. The film is set in 1984, and the main goal of the movie is to have
  the viewers decide which way it goes. Stefan is creating a game that is "choose your own adventure" just like the viewers
are choosing options for him. He is a young programmer who is looking to develop his game, and hopes to work with Tuckersoft, a well known game developing company. The plot of
the film is mainly based on the viewers, as there are only 5 real endings. Some choices made by the viewers will make them "fail" the
game and restarts the movie for the viewer. The main plot of the interactive film is how Stefan realizes he is being controlled. After he
talks to his dad and therapist about it, he realizes (or the viewer realizes) that this is just one reality out of many and it won't
have affects on anyone. As Stefan progresses through discovering who he is, he finds evidence that everything in his life has been planned
and he was just an experiment controlled by PAC, an organization known as 'Program and Control'.</p>
<p>Thoughts: I remember waking up the day Bandersnatch was released to spend the next 5-6 hours playing through each of the different scenarios. I was
ecstatic to see this film come out remembering how much I loved The Truman Show, but this time I got to control the outcome of the film. Not only that,
but I had never seen an interactive film before. Netflix had started doing deals for interactive films and I am glad that Black Mirror got to participate, expecially
when it was my favorite TV show at the time. I never expected how this film would break the 4th wall and invite the viewer to be a part of the film. As Stefan
realized he was being controlled, it was very interesting to watch how the actor would interact with the viewer and recognize the choices you make. I also love
how complex the plot is and the work that went behind creating so many different scenes while organizing it to make sense to the viewer. Bandersnatch did an amazing
job at creating their first interactive film, and I hope they create more in the future.</p>
