    <h1>The Truman Show</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Released: 1998</p>
    <p>Genre: Psychological comedy-drama</p>
    <p>Directed by: Peter Weir</p>
    <p>About: The Truman Show is centered around the main character, Truman, who is unknowingly a part of a reality TV series called 'The Truman Show'
    which is broadcasted famously around the world. Truman is very well known although he lives a very ritualistic life with not much going on. Truman
  was adopted by the show and is used as a source of entertainment for many people. His life is built in a dome and he has never travelled anywhere else
except his 'home town'. His life is completely false and everyone knows it except him. The director, Christof, strategically keeps Truman kept in this
false world by faking his dad's death in a boating accident when Truman was younger, causing him to have a fear of water and never escaping where he is from.
He began to suspect his false world as he notices Meryl, an extra quickly removed once the cast found out her intentions were to tell Truman the truth about
where he is from. Truman's love for Meryl is what sets him free from his false reality, and is what leads him to leaving the dome and discovering the real world.</p>
<p>Thoughts: When I first watched The Truman Show about 6 years ago, I completely fell in love with the style of the film and how it was curated. I have never watched
  a movie like that before and wanted to learn more about it and rewatch it again and again. This film shows how people need free will, and also goes to show how
  powerful love is. I truly love how this movie was filmed from the perspective of people in real life and the 'cast' playing their roles in Truman's world.</p>
